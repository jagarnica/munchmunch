# Running the front end client 
In the client folder, you should just have to run: 
```shell
yarn install
```
in order to fetch all the needed packages. You will need [gatsbyJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby#-get-up-and-running-in-5-minutes) installed globally in order to use the CLI and run the app locally. 
If you don't have it installed running: 
```shell
yarn global add gatsby
```
should have you up and running. After doing that, in the "client" folder run: 

```shell 
gatsby develop
```
and you will have a hot reloading test version of the app.
